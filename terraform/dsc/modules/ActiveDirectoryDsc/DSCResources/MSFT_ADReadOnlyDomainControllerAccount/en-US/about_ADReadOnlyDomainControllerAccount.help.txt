.NAME
    ADReadOnlyDomainControllerAccount

.DESCRIPTION
    The ADReadOnlyDomainControllerAccount DSC resource will pre-create a read only domain
    controller account in Active Directory. This allows the account actually installing
    the read only domain controller to use delegated administrative credentials supplied in
    DelegatedAdministratorAccountName rather than requiring Domain Admins permissions.

    > The resource does not support removing pre-created Read Only Domain Controller accounts.

    ## Requirements
